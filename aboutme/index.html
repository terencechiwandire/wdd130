    <h1>Terence Chiwandire</h1>
    <p>My name is Terence Chiwandire. I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. I have been a member
        of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for about 20 years. I served my mission in 2008
        and returned in 2010. I have been married to my beautiful wife for 6 years, and we have 2 beautiful girls, Nakai and Tawana aged 4 years 
        and 1 year, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>I love being in the outdoors. My favorite activity is playing soccer, especially with the brethren from my Stake.
        We play soccer every Saturday morning and I look forward to this every day of the week. I love meeting new people and gegtting 
        to know them. I look forward to meeting everyone in this course with me as we learn together.
