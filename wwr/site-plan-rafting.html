    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>A website brings in the professionalism factor and our company needs to have a website so that it looks as professional as it is. The website will be set up in a way to 
        attract more visitors to Rafting Travel. More visitors will generate more revenue and more profits. More revenue means that the company will last long and facilities and infrastructure will 
        be well maintained. 
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our website will target young adults from age 18 to 30. We will also aim at attracting young couples who are just starting out and have little children as our business is family friendly.
        Our color pallet will consist of light shades of green and blue. This is in keeping with the major colors of nature. Rafting is an opportunity for people to experience the beauties of nature as they raft downstream. We are targeting young adults as this is the likely age group that will 
        enjoy the adrelin from the rapids in our river. Our fonts should be readable and easy on the eye. We will use mostly open sans for the paragraphs and a stylish font for our heading, the Grape nut, which looks quite hand written. This age group enjoys images more than reading plain text and so our site will have more pictures than text.
        MOst of these guys are on their phones more than they are on the laptop or desktop. Our site will however be optimized for both.
