      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my site is to advertise the power back up systems for all potential customers to see. I intend to show the packages of these systems
        that we have, and what they cost. I am to use the site to tell the whole story about our business and increase the number of customers, and thereby make more profits from selling 
        our systems.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I will target mainly home owners who can install solar panels and the related back up componets without any hassles of rented spaces. This will be any individual from ages 21 upwards.
        The whole country is affected by too many power outages, thus we are to cater to a big audience.

        What is our business about?
        We specialize in proving everyone, both residential and commercial, with power back-up systems. We understand that power cuts present a challenge in many different aspects of your life. Electrical appliances are at risk of getting damaged with constant outages and restorations of power, the food your store in your fridge/freezer might get spoiled if there is an inconsistent supply of electricity. For those who mostly work from home, it is a known fact that it becomes difficult to accomplish your tasks without electricity. Our role is to provide natural, affordable, and reliable alternative energy that will keep you going even when others are in the dark.

Our products
Due to the ongoing crisis of loadshedding/power outages, our alternative power supplies are what everyone needs. You will enjoy peace of mind knowing that you will have a constant supply of electricity. We offer individual components, as well as packages that include the whole system needed to provide alternative power to your home or business. We have a team of qualified technicians who handle the installations of these systems and ensure that they are serviced over a period of time to ascertain optimum functionality. 

The components
The main components that make up a solar/back-up system are; the photovoltaic (PV) panels, inverter, battery (gel or lithium-ion batteries). These are accompanied by the small units that bring them together to make a complete set of equipment that is required to produce electricity using the sun’s energy.

      </ul>
      <h3>Packages</h3>
      <p>
       
The process
The PV panels capture the energy of the sun’s raise and converts them into electrical energy. This electricity is then processed by the inverter and converted into a current that can be used by household appliances or industrial machinery. The same energy is stored in the batteries for later use. This process happens repeatedly throughout the day and works independently of the main electrical grid. At sun set and throughout the night, the energy stored in the batteries then powers your appliances and lights until the PV panels resume their work of converting the sun’s energy into electricity. 
A big advantage of all this is that you can go completely off-grid, which means you do not need to depend on the electricity supplied through the grid, which is in any case, undependable. Apart from this, you also get to save a lot of money in the long run as you will be producing your own electricity, through this eco-friendly system. You will be able to do your work uninterrupted, thereby increasing your productivity. We have also noticed that constant power-cuts are very stressful and can impact on your health. Thus, installing a solar system will indirectly boost your wellbeing as there will be no worries caused by power outages.
